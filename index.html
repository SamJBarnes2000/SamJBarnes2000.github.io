                            <h2>How To Find The Best Speaker?</h2>
                            <p>This is easy! its different for everyone. If your a person that likes 
                                a small compact speeker to have on the go, get a small one. On the 
                                other scale if you want to stand out and be the life of the party, 
                                we have you coverd with larger speakers. If your someone who likes alot of bass or more 
                                of vocals, we have both coverd. The main thing to do is when browsing 
                                read up on them, if your not too sure that we have given enough 
                                information, look the model up online and reaserch it more, the 
                                manafacturer is the best place to go. If you think we dont have 
                                something that might be useful to know about a speeker or if your 
                                desired speeker isnt here, flick us an email using the Contact Page 
                                and we will get right on that!</p>
